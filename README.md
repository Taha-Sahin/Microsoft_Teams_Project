- The program will ask you for put some delay. Write 0 for instant run. 
- After that, leave it to the program. It will search for meeting in your channels and if it finds a meeting, will join.
- It is recording the current people number and finds the max people that have joined the meeting. If current people count will drop down below %30 of max people, it will quit the meeting and the program will be closed
